# near-api-js-proposal

The purpose of creating a new NEAR API for Javascript and Typescript is to align with the equivalent libraries for [Rust](https://github.com/near/near-api-rs) and [Python](https://github.com/near/near-api-py), with developer experience in focus. The library should have full test coverage from day one, where all usage examples are part of the test suite. It should be usable from NodeJS, and in the web browser, supporting Vanilla JS and frameworks like React or Angular. As a client library for a blockchain, there will be dependencies on crypto libraries. This library will expose interfaces for implementation of adapters to a crypto-library of choice, implemented in JS or WebAssembly, or to use native implementations in NodeJS or Browser APIs where it is available.
